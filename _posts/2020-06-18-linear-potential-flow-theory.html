<code>DISCLAIMER 1:</code> John von Neumann referred to potential flow theory as the study of
'dry water'.
</p>

<p>
<code>DISCLAIMER 2:</code> Richard Feynman stated that potential flow theory had nothing to
do with 'real fluids' and that it was more to do with solving beautiful
mathematical problems&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Despite the simplications, potential flow theory is incredibly important to WEC
numerical modelling - enabling the modelling of a wide range of operating
conditions in a fraction of the time of higher-fidelity approaches such as CFD
and SPH.
</p>

<p>
Frequency-domain linear potential flow solvers such as WAMIT and NEMOH
(so-called 'boundary element method (BEM) codes') are well-established in the
hydrodynamics field, and the foundation of most time-domain solvers. However,
they are often treated as a black box. This article aims to elucidate some of
the underlying theory in a clear, succint manner.

<h2 id="org2ad8fcc"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Fundamentals and main assumptions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
In order to model fluid motion, we essentially need to be able to determine
the velocity vector \(\vec{v}(x, y, z, t)\) of a fluid particle at any point
within the flow:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt} = \begin{bmatrix}
  u \\
  v \\
  w
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}</li>

<li>However, there are other fluid properties which may also vary throughout the
flow, over time. To simplify the model, we can assume these remain
constant.</li>

<li><p>
If we assume the fluid to be incompressible, then its density must remain
constant:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\rho = const.
\end{equation}</li>

<li><p>
This assumption means the divergence of the flow's velocity must be zero,
hence the continuity (conservation of mass) equation is:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} +
\frac{\partial w}{\partial z} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \vec{v} = 0
\end{equation}</li>

<li><p>
Potential flow theory also assumes that the the flow is inviscid (i.e. the
fluid cannot experience any shear stresses) from \(t=0s\), and therefore the
vorticity must be zero everywhere - hence the fluid is irrotational:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:irrotational}
  \nabla \times \vec{v} = 0
\end{equation}</li>

<li><p>
Under these simplifictions, the velocity vector, \(\vec{v}(x, y, z, t)\) may
be replaced with a mathematical abstraction: the gradient of a scalar
potential, \(\phi(x, y, z, t)\):
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:scalar_potential}
\vec{v} = \nabla\phi = \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \\
  \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \\
  \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}</li>

<li>In this approach, instead of computing 3 unknown velocity vector components,
only 1 unknown scalar quantity needs to be determined, from which all three
velocity components can be derived.</li>

<li><p>
Inserting Equation \ref{eq:scalar_potential} into
Equation \ref{eq:irrotational} gives the Laplace equation:
</p>
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:laplace}
\nabla^2 \phi = 0
\end{equation}</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
The free surface cannot withstand pressure differences, this is applied via
Bernoulli's equation:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Bernoulli}
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}(\nabla \phi)^2 +
\frac{p_0}{\rho} + g\eta = C 
\end{equation}
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Where the constant, \(C = \frac{p_0}{\rho}\). By assuming that the
wavelength is much larger than the wave amplitude, the second order term
in Equation \ref{eq:Bernoulli} can be assumed to be small, hence the
boundary condition becomes:</li>
</ul>

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:BernoulliLinear}
\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t} + g\eta = 0
\end{equation}</li>

<li><p>
The free surface is also impermeable, hence the fluid velocity normal to the
surface must be equal to the surface velocity:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fsImpermeable}
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t}
+ \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}
+ \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}
+ \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} = 0
\end{equation}

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Again, by assuming that the wavelength is much larger than the wave
amplitude, the second order terms in Equation \ref{eq:fsImpermeable} can
be assumed to be small, hence the boundary condition becomes:</li>
</ul>

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fsImpermeableLinear}
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} = 0
\end{equation}</li>

<li><p>
By introducing Equation \ref{eq:fsImpermeableLinear} into the
time-derivative of Equation \ref{eq:BernoulliLinear}, the generalized form
of the free surface boundary condition is: 
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fsBoundaryCondition}
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} - g \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} = 0
\end{equation}</li>

<li><p>
Assuming the seabed is flat and impermeable, there must be no vertical
velocity component:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} = 0
\end{equation}</li>

<li><p>
Similarly, the wetted surface of the body in the fluid is impermeable, hence
the fluid velocity normal to the body surface, \(u_n\) must be equal to the
body velocity in the direction normal to its surface:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} = u_n
\end{equation}</li>

<li><p>
The final condition is that radiated waves must decay with increasing
distance from the body:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\phi \propto (kr)^{\frac{1}{2}}e^{ikr}
\end{equation}

<p>
As \(r \rightarrow \infty\), where \(r\) is the radial distance and \(k\) is the
wave number:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\frac{\omega^2}{g} = ktanh(kh)
\end{equation}</li>

<h2 id="org17d76be"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Solving for hydrodynamic forces</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
To obtain the hydrodynamic forces experienced by a body in the flow, we
essentially need to integrate the dynamic pressure exerted on the (mean)
wetted body surface, \(S_b\):
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:potentialHydrodynamics}
\vec{f}_{hd} = \rho \int_{S_b}\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} n dS_b
\end{equation}

<p>
Where \(n\) is the unit vector normal to the body surface.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Under the linearity assumption, the velocity potential can be decomposed
into 2 components describing the diffracted and radiated wave fields:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\phi = \phi_D + \phi_{rad}
\end{equation}</li>

<li><p>
Where the diffracted wave potential is:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\phi_D = \phi_0 + \phi_s
\end{equation}

<p>
&phi;<sub>0</sub> represents the incident wave potential and \(\phi_s\) represents
the scattered wave potential.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Hence, Equation \ref{eq:potentialHydrodynamics} can be expressed in terms of
the complex vectors of the excitation and radiation components:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\hat{f}_{hd} = \hat{f}_{ex} + \hat{f}_{rad}
\end{equation}</li>

<li><p>
\(f_{ex}\) has two components: the Froude-Krylov force, \(f_{FK}\) - associated
with the undisturbed incident wave. And the scatter force, \(f_s\), which
results from waves interacting with the body and diffracting/scattering
across the free surface<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. In
the frequency-domain:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\hat{f}_{FK}(\omega) = i\omega\rho \int_{S_b} \hat{\phi}_0 n dS_b
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\hat{f}_{s}(\omega) = i\omega\rho \int_{S_b} \hat{\phi}_s n dS_b
\end{equation}</li>

<li><p>
As a body oscillates in a fluid, it radiates waves - which results in a
damping force experienced by the body, \(f_{rad}\). There is also an added
mass effect due the body forcing the motion of some fluid in its vicinity.
The analogy of electrical impedance (resistance and reactance) is commonly
used (denoted by \(Z(\omega)\)):
</p>

\begin{equation}
\hat{f}_{rad}(\omega) = -i \omega Z(\omega) \hat{\vec{s}}(\omega)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Z(\omega) = -i\omega\rho \int_{S_b} \phi_{rad} n dS_b = \mathbf{B}(\omega) +
i\omega\mathbf{A}(\omega) 
\end{equation}

<p>
(Where \(\mathbf{B}(\omega)\) is radiation damping and \(\mathbf{A}(\omega)\) is
added mass).
</p></li>

<li><p>
The radiation and diffraction potentials can be represented by the potential
formulation of Green's theorem:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Green}
\begin{pmatrix}
  2 \pi \\
  4 \pi
\end{pmatrix} \phi + \int \int_{S_b} \phi G_{n\xi} dS_{\xi}
= \int \int_{S_b} \phi_n G dS_{\xi}
\end{equation}</li>

<li>The Green function, \(G(\vec{\xi}, \vec{x})\), corresponds to the potential
of an oscillatory source, located at the point \(\vec{\xi}=\vec{x}\) (where
\(\vec{\xi}\) is the position vector of a point on the body's surface and
\(\vec{x}\) is the position vector of a point within the fluid domain.</li>

<li><p>
This equation can also be expressed in terms of the source distribution,
\(\sigma\):
</p>

\begin{equation}
\phi = \int\int_{S_b} \sigma(y) G(x, y) dS(y)
\end{equation}</li>
